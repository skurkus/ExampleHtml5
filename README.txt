Html5 | CSS3 | Fully Responsive

Be careful not to compile the scss files because the main.css file has been 
modified afterwards. The changes made will be reported in the scss files later.

This is a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
